    """
    Return element-wise quotient and remainder simultaneously.

    ``numpoly.divmod(x, y)`` is equivalent to ``(x / y, x % y)``, but faster
    because it avoids redundant work. It is used to implement the Python
    built-in function ``divmod`` on Numpoly arrays.

    Notes:
        Unlike numbers, this returns the polynomial division and polynomial
        remainder. This means that this function is _not_ backwards compatible
        with ``numpy.divmod`` for constants. For example:
        ``numpy.divmod(11, 2) == (5, 1)`` while
        ``numpoly.divmod(11, 2) == (5.5, 0)``.

    Args:
        dividend (numpoly.ndpoly):
            The array being divided.
        divisor (numpoly.ndpoly):
            Array that that will divide the dividend.
        out (Tuple[Optional[numpoly.ndpoly], Optional[numpoly.ndpoly]]):
            A location into which the result is stored. If provided, it must
            have a shape that the inputs broadcast to. If not provided or
            `None`, a freshly-allocated array is returned. A tuple (possible
            only as a keyword argument) must have length equal to the number of
            outputs.
        where (bool, numpy.ndarray):
            This condition is broadcast over the input. At locations where the
            condition is True, the `out` array will be set to the ufunc result.
            Elsewhere, the `out` array will retain its original value. Note
            that if an uninitialized `out` array is created via the default
            ``out=None``, locations within it where the condition is False will
            remain uninitialized.
        kwargs:
            Keyword args passed to numpy.ufunc.

    Returns:
        (Tuple[numpoly.ndpoly, numpoly.ndpoly]):
            Element-wise quotient and remainder resulting from
            floor division. This is a scalar if both `x1` and `x2`
            are scalars.

    Examples:
        >>> q0, q1 = numpoly.variable(2)
        >>> denominator = [q0*q1**2+2*q0**3*q1**2, -2+q0*q1**2]
        >>> numerator = -2+q0*q1**2
        >>> floor, remainder = numpoly.poly_divmod(
        ...     denominator, numerator)
        >>> floor
        polynomial([2.0*q0**2+1.0, 1.0])
        >>> remainder
        polynomial([4.0*q0**2+2.0, 0.0])
        >>> floor*numerator+remainder
        polynomial([2.0*q0**3*q1**2+q0*q1**2, q0*q1**2-2.0])
